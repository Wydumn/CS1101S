# CS1101S Programming Methodology

__AY2016/2017 Semester 1<br>
School of Computing<br>
National University of Singapore__

#### Taught by [Martin Henz](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/) and [Low Kok-Lim](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkl/)

[CS1101S](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/) is a module taught in the Department of Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. It serves as a rigorous and thorough introduction to programming methodology. The module follows the didactic strategy of the classic textbook _Structure and Interpretation of Computer programs (SICP)_, which Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman developed for MIT introductory programming class 6.001.

It is taught in __Source__, a sub-language of __JavaScript__. The module is run on a digital platform, called [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/).

## About Me

I was an Year 1 undergraduate student at NUS when taking this course. My major is Computer Engineering. I love programming and solving challenges. I received NUS Science & Technology (S&T) Scholarship and had good academic results.

## My Slides

[Yunpeng](https://yunpengn.github.io/) has served as tutor for CS1101S twice, in AY2017/2018 Semester 1 and AY2018/2019 Semester 1 respectively. To give back to the community and benefit students from the future batches, Yunpeng has decided to open-source his slides for the tutorial sessions.
