__AY2016/2017 Semester 1<br>
School of Computing<br>
National University of Singapore__

#### Taught by [Martin Henz](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~henz/) and [Low Kok-Lim](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkl/)

[CS1101S](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/) is a module taught in the Department of Computer Science at the NUS School of Computing. It serves as a rigorous and thorough introduction to programming methodology. The module follows the didactic strategy of the classic textbook _Structure and Interpretation of Computer programs (SICP)_, which Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman developed for MIT introductory programming class 6.001.

It is taught in __Source__, a sub-language of __JavaScript__. The module is run on a digital platform, called [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/).
